# Deadline Exceeded Front-End Notes

This document describes a practical front-end implementation note for the CasinosPH project, with emphasis on responsive components. The page should begin with semantic HTML so the content remains readable before JavaScript runs. A reliable document shell includes a header for brand navigation, a `main` element for the unique page body, reusable sections for cards or guides, and a footer for support links. Keeping this structure consistent helps templates, markdown rendering, and client-side routes share the same content model.

```html
<main class="page-shell">
  <section class="page-intro">
    <h1>Deadline Exceeded Front-End Notes</h1>
    <p>Concise summary copy for readers and search previews.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="content-grid" aria-label="Featured guides"></section>
</main>
```

The CSS layer should use tokens rather than one-off values. Define variables for text color, muted copy, surface color, accent color, spacing, and border radius, then reuse those variables in cards, buttons, link lists, and comparison rows. This makes visual updates safer because the component classes stay stable while the design system evolves. Layouts should use grid or flex rules with clear breakpoints, and mobile views should collapse gracefully without hiding important content.

```css
.page-shell {
  max-width: 1120px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 24px;
}

.content-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(240px, 1fr));
  gap: 16px;
}
```

Interactive elements should use real buttons and links, visible focus outlines, and descriptive labels. Accordions should keep `aria-expanded` synchronized with the open panel, while filter controls should update status text so users understand what changed. Images need useful `alt` text, and decorative icons should be hidden from assistive technology.
